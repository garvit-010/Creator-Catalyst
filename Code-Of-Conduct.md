- GitHub issues

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, or pull requests that violate this Code of Conduct  
- Temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful  

---

## Enforcement Guidelines

When a violation occurs, maintainers may take one or more of the following actions, depending on severity:

1. **Correction**  
   A private or public message explaining why the behavior was inappropriate and how to improve.

2. **Warning**  
   A formal warning that continued unacceptable behavior may result in further consequences.

3. **Temporary Ban**  
   Temporary removal from project participation.

4. **Permanent Ban**  
   Permanent removal from all project spaces.

The goal of enforcement is to protect the community, not to punish unnecessarily.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report
- Open a **private security issue**, or  
- Contact the maintainers directly via the repository’s listed contact method  

All reports will be reviewed confidentially and investigated promptly.

We will respect the privacy and safety of reporters to the greatest extent possible.

## Community Values

Creator Catalyst exists to empower creators through technology. That mission requires:

- Trust  
- Respect  
- Collaboration  
- Accountability  

Disrespectful behavior undermines the project and will not be tolerated.
