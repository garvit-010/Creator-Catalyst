# 🚀 Creator Catalyst

Tired of the content grind? **Creator Catalyst** is your AI-powered co-pilot designed to solve the biggest challenge in the creator economy: content repurposing.  

This tool takes a single long-form video and, in minutes, automatically transforms it into a complete suite of ready-to-publish assets, turning one piece of content into a full-blown marketing campaign.

## 🌟Key Features

Creator Catalyst analyzes your video and generates a multi-format content strategy automatically:

- 🎙️ **Accurate SRT Captions**: Generates a complete, properly formatted `.srt` transcript to make your videos accessible and boost SEO.  
- ✂️ **Viral Shorts Ideas**: Identifies at least five high-impact moments from your video, providing topics, timestamps, and summaries. You can then clip and download these shorts directly from the app.  
- 📝 **Full-Length Blog Post**: Writes a well-structured, engaging blog article (300–400 words) based on the video's content, ready for your website.  
- 📱 **Engaging Social Post**: Crafts a concise and catchy post, complete with hashtags, perfect for sharing on platforms like X (Twitter) or LinkedIn.  
- 🎨 **Clickable Thumbnails**: Generates three distinct, visually descriptive prompts for thumbnails. You can then generate these images with a single click, optionally providing a reference image to guide the AI's style.
